# 30-Day-LeetCoding-Challenge-April
This is a dump of all my solutions for April Challenge coded in Java. Some solutions are not the most optimal solutions or properly written, I might update some of the interesting ones. 

If you are stuck at any of the problems please refer to @Errichto's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg) where he goes through all the 30 questions. You can also refer to his GitHub repo where you can find code in cpp [(here)](https://github.com/Errichto/youtube/tree/master/leetcode/april-2020-challenge).
